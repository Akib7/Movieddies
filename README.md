This is Movieddies, an app where you can search for your desired movies, add to your favorite list as well as watchlist. You can get all the information of a particular movie including rating, imdb site, trailer, top cast and so on. The movies can be chosen by different genres. There is dark and light mode as well to get a better experience with the app. You can login to add movies to your lists. Moreover, the interesting thing is the Alan Ai, by which you can search or do other things by using your voice. NB: Start by saying "What does this app do?", that is after clicking the mic button of course. 

Enjoy.
